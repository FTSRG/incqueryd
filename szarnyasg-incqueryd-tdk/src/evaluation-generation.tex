\section{Generation of models}

We created a property graph generator project based on the previous \tb{} generators. The generator creates a graph in a Neo4j database and uses the Blueprints library's \texttt{GraphMLWriter} and \texttt{GraphSONWriter} classes to serialize the graph to \graphml{} and Blueprints \graphson{} formats. It is also capable of serializing the graph to Faunus \graphson{} format.
