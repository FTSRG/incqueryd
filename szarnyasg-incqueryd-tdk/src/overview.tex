\label{chap:overview}

The primary goal of \iqd{} is to provide a scalable architecture for executing incremental queries over large models. Our approach is based on the following foundations: (i) a distributed model storage system that (ii) supports a graph-oriented data representation format, and (iii) a graph query language (adapted from the \eiq{} framework). The novel contribution of this report is an architecture and an implementation that consists of a (i) distributed model management middleware, and a (ii) distributed and stateful pattern matcher network based on the Rete algorithm.

\iqd{} provides incremental query execution by \emph{indexing model contents} and \emph{capturing model manipulation operations} in the middleware layer, and \emph{propagating change tokens} along the pattern matcher network to \emph{produce query results and query result changes} (corresponding to model manipulation transactions) efficiently. As the primary sources of memory consumption, i.e.\ both the indexing and intermediate Rete nodes can be distributed in a cloud infrastructure, the system is expected to scale well beyond the limitations of the traditional single workstation setup.
