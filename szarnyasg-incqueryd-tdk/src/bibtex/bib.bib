	collection of patterns to a large collection of objects. It finds
	all the objects that match each pattern. The algorithm was developed
	for use in production system interpreters, and it has been used for
	systems containing from a few hundred to more than a thousand patterns
	and objects. This article presents the algorithm in detail. It explains
	the basic concepts of the algorithm, it describes pattern and object
	representations that are appropriate for the algorithm, and it describes
	the operations performed by the pattern matcher.},

	abstract = {<p>Design space exploration (DSE) aims at searching through various models representing different design candidates to support activities like configuration design of critical systems or automated maintenance of IT systems. In model-driven engineering, DSE is applied to find instance models that are (i) reachable from an initial model with a sequence of transformation rules and (ii) satisfy a set of structural and numerical constraints. Since exhaustive exploration of the design space is infeasible for large models, the traversal is often guided by hints, derived by system analysis, to prioritize the next states to traverse (selection criteria) and to avoid searching unpromising states (cut-off criteria). In this paper, we define an exploration approach where selection and cut-off criteria are defined using dependency analysis of transformation rules and an algebraic abstraction. The approach is evaluated against other exploration techniques and illustrated on a cloud infrastructure configuration problem.</p>
