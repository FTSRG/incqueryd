  abstract = {The Rete Match Algorithm is an efficient method for comparing a large
	collection of patterns to a large collection of objects. It finds
	all the objects that match each pattern. The algorithm was developed
	for use in production system interpreters, and it has been used for
	systems containing from a few hundred to more than a thousand patterns
	and objects. This article presents the algorithm in detail. It explains
	the basic concepts of the algorithm, it describes pattern and object
	representations that are appropriate for the algorithm, and it describes
	the operations performed by the pattern matcher.},

	abstract = {<p>Design space exploration (DSE) aims at searching through various models representing different design candidates to support activities like configuration design of critical systems or automated maintenance of IT systems. In model-driven engineering, DSE is applied to find instance models that are (i) reachable from an initial model with a sequence of transformation rules and (ii) satisfy a set of structural and numerical constraints. Since exhaustive exploration of the design space is infeasible for large models, the traversal is often guided by hints, derived by system analysis, to prioritize the next states to traverse (selection criteria) and to avoid searching unpromising states (cut-off criteria). In this paper, we define an exploration approach where selection and cut-off criteria are defined using dependency analysis of transformation rules and an algebraic abstraction. The approach is evaluated against other exploration techniques and illustrated on a cloud infrastructure configuration problem.</p>

	In graph transformation, the most cost-intensive phase of a transformation execution is pattern matching, where those subgraphs of a model graph are identified and matched which satisfy constraints prescribed by graph patterns. Incremental pattern matching aims to improve the efficiency of this critical step by storing the set of matches of a graph transformation rule and incrementally maintaining it as the model changes, thus eliminating the need of recalculating existing matches of a pattern. In this paper, we propose examples where incremental pattern matching is expected to have advantageous effect in the application domain of model simulation and model synchronization. Moreover, we compare the incremental graph pattern matching approach of Viatra2 with advanced non-incremental local-search based graph pattern matching approaches (as available in Viatra2 and GrGen).</p>

Then, an adaptive approach for graph pattern matching is presented, where the optimal search plan can be selected from previously generated search plans at run-time based on statistical data collected from the current instance model under transformation.},

        abstract = {This paper proposes a different type of Genetic Network Programming ({GNP)} Variable Size Genetic Network Programming ({GNPvs)} with Binomial Distribution. In contrast to the individuals with fixed size in Standard {GNP}, {GNPvs} will change the size of the individuals and obtain the optimal size of them during evolution. The proposed method defines a new type of crossover to implement the new feature of {GNP.} The new crossover will select the number of nodes to move from each parent {GNP} to another parent {GNP.} The probability of selecting the number of nodes to move satisfies the binomial probability distribution. The proposed method can keep the effectiveness of crossover and improve the performance of {GNP.} In order to verify the performance of the proposed method, a well-known benchmark problem Tile-world is used in the simulations. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},
