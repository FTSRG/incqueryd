\subsection{Hardware, software ecosystem}

As the testbed, we deployed our system to a private cloud consisting of 4 virtual machines on separate host computers. 

\subsubsection{Hardware}

For Titan and 4store, each virtual machine used dual 2.5 GHz Intel Xeon L5420 CPUs with 8 GBs of RAM, running on Ubuntu 12.10 64-bit.

For Neo4j, each virtual machine had the same parameters but twice as much, 16 GBs of RAM. 

\subsubsection{Software}

We used the following technologies:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Ubuntu 12.10 64-bit
  \item Oracle Java 7 64-bit
  \item 4store 1.1.5
  \item Titan 0.3.2
  \item Faunus 0.3.2
  \item Hadoop 1.1.2
  \item Cassandra 1.2.2
  \item Neo4j 1.8
  \item Blueprint 2.3.0
  \item Akka 2.1.2
  \item Eclipse 4.3 (Kepler)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Benchmark methodology}

\subsection{Data collection}

\subsection{Data processing tools}

To compare the performance characteristics of \iqd{} to a traditional case, we defined two scenarios. The \textit{batch} scenario uses only Neo4j to manage models and evaluate the queries in a parallelized way (depicted as \textcircled{1} in \figref{architecture}). This serves as a baseline for the \textit{incremental} scenario, which uses \iqd{} (shown as \textcircled{2} in \figref{architecture}). For these initial experiments, the layout and allocation of the Rete network was determined manually.
