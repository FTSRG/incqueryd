\section{Summary}

Our benchmarks proved that the concept of a distributed, incremental pattern matcher is a working one. \iqd{}'s scalability characteristics confirmed that while network overhead is present, it is possible to keep \eiq{}'s almost constant performance characteristics in a distributed environment. The results show the model size barrier, primarily caused by limitations of memory [TODO REF] \autoref{memory}, can be pushed further using a horizontal scaling approach.

%   - derived conclusions
%     - proof of concept
%     - scalable in this setup
%     - kept EMF-IncQuery's characteristics
%     - small overhead
%     - model size barrier pushed further
%     - not all distributed scalability aspects covered

It is important to note that our benchmark did not cover all aspects of distributed scalability. ..
