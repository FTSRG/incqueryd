\chapter{Evaluation of Scalability and Performance}
\label{chap:evaluation}

We implemented \iqd{} as an initial prototype to evaluate the feasibility of the approach. In the following chapter, we introduce the \tb{}, a performance benchmark for query engines. We also present the distributed \tb{}, which is also capable of measuring certain scalability aspects.
