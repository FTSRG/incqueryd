%We implemented \iqd{} as an initial prototype to evaluate the feasibility of the approach, and to experiment with various optimization possibilities. As the storage, we used the popular graph database Neo4j~\cite{neo4j} featuring automatic indexes and two core query technologies (Gremlin and Cypher) that were used as a low-level model access interface by our middleware layer.
