\section{Distributed \tb{}}
\label{distributed-trainbenchmark}



- based on the \tb{}, I created an extended version for distributed systems. 
  - cite ASE article
  - TrainBenchmark
  - models in different format
  - different technologies
  - different workflow (queries, model manipulation)
  - measure eponse time, not throughput
  - we increate the model's size --> query results size increases
  - read check edit check phases
  - the benchmark runs on a coordinator and delegates the operations to a distributed system
  - one user uses the entire cluster (for benchmarking purposes)
