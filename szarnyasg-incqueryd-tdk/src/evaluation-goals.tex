\subsection{Phases}

The \tb{} consists of the following phases:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item $\mathit{read}$: loading the model,
  \item $\mathit{check}_0$: running the queries,
  \item $\mathit{edit}_i$: editing the model, 
  \item $\mathit{check}_i$: running the queries again.
\end{enumerate}

In a ''real-world'' model editing sequence, the user tipically edits the model in small steps ($\mathit{edit}_i$ phases). The user's work is much more productive if she receives an instant feedback, hence we would like to run re-evaluate well-formedness queries quickly (preferably in sub-second time). This creates the need for an incremental pattern matcher tools.

\subsection{Measure the response time and the scalability}

\subsection{Workload profile's difference from standard benchmarks}
