Highlights:

- Distributed system with Akka and remote actor deployment.
- Use of Maven shade plug-in.
- Creating WAR and JAR files from Maven.
- Two phase parsing with a partial StAX parser: <root> ... </root> hack.
    - java.xml.stream was buggy so used the WoodStox library instead. 
- Asynchronous insertion with synchronized primitives.
- Distributed file system (HDFS) accessed through custom InputStream (FSDataInputStream).
- Simple progressbar on web UI.

Development:
- junit tests -- some progress
- insertion, deletion -- some progress
