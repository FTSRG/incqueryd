Highlights:

- Distributed system with Akka and remote actor deployment.
- Coordinator runnable with JRE.
- Use of Maven shade plug-in.
- Two phase parsing with a partial StAX parser: <root> ... </root> hack.
    - java.xml.stream was buggy so used the WoodStox library instead. 
- Asynchronous insertion with synchronized primitives.
- Distributed file system (HDFS) accessed through custom InputStream (FSDataInputStream).
- Progressbar on web UI.
